# SOC Core Concepts

This repository is a **theory-first knowledge base** covering the core concepts required for a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst. It focuses on understanding *how systems work, how attacks happen, and how defenders reason about them*—before touching tools or alerts.

Each file in this repository is a **concise, standalone concept summary**. The goal is clarity, not volume. Every concept is reduced to its essentials so it can be quickly reviewed, retained, and referenced during investigations or interviews.

## Purpose of This Repository
- Build a strong mental model of cybersecurity fundamentals  
- Understand attacker behavior, defender logic, and system internals  
- Support hands-on labs without duplicating practical documentation  
- Serve as a revision guide for SOC Level 1 roles  

## How This Fits Into the Overall Strategy
- **This repo** → Concepts only (short, clean explanations)
- **Mini Tasks repo** → Hands-on labs and practical exercises
- **MITRE ATT&CK repo** → Technique-focused attacker simulations
- **Incident repo** → Realistic investigation-style writeups

Concepts documented here are later **translated into practical detection or investigation labs**, but the lab steps themselves are intentionally kept out of this repository.

## Documentation Style
- One topic per `.md` file  
- Short, structured explanations  
- No unnecessary screenshots or filler  
- Focus on *why* something matters in SOC operations  

This repository represents the **foundation layer** of the learning journey: understanding first, execution second, mastery over time.
