## Defensive Security Overview

Defensive security, commonly known as the **Blue Team**, focuses on protecting an organization’s infrastructure from attacks. The primary goal is to **prevent intrusions**, **detect malicious activity when it occurs**, and **respond quickly to minimize damage**.

A key part of defensive security is **user awareness and training**. Employees must understand threats such as phishing and basic network risks, because human error is often the weakest link. Asset management is equally important; knowing exactly **what systems, devices, and data exist** allows defenders to protect them effectively.

Firewalls act as the **first line of defense**, controlling what traffic is allowed into and out of the network. Continuous **log monitoring** is critical, as logs provide visibility into system activity and help identify suspicious behavior early. Defensive teams also create and enforce **security policies and rules** to reduce risk and ensure consistent protection across the organization.

## Security Operations Center (SOC)

A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is a centralized team responsible for **continuous monitoring, detection, and response** to security incidents. SOC analysts monitor alerts, investigate suspicious activity, and take action when an intrusion or policy violation is detected.

SOC professionals must stay **up to date with evolving threats**, tools, and attack techniques. The SOC enforces security policies that define what is considered **normal and acceptable behavior** within the organization. Any activity beyond these defined boundaries is treated as a potential threat.

No system is ever completely secure. Breaches are always possible, which is why the SOC’s responsibility is to **detect incidents early**, respond quickly, and reduce the impact on the organization.

## Digital Forensics

Digital forensics is the science of **collecting, analyzing, and preserving digital evidence** after a security incident. It helps investigators understand **what happened, how it happened, and who was involved**.

Forensic analysis can involve examining **file systems**, including installed applications, system files, and deleted or partially overwritten data. Memory analysis can reveal information about **malicious programs that ran only in RAM** without being saved to disk.

System and security logs are extremely important in digital forensics. Even if an attacker deletes files, **log artifacts and traces often remain**. Network logs provide insight into communication patterns and can help determine whether an attack is ongoing or identify attacker infrastructure.

## Incident Response

Incident response is a structured process used to **handle security events such as breaches, malware infections, and data leaks**. Its goal is to limit damage, contain the threat, and restore normal operations.

Preparation is the foundation of incident response and includes planning, defining procedures, and training employees. Detection and analysis involve identifying the incident and examining logs and alerts to understand its scope and impact.

Containment focuses on stopping the spread of the threat, such as isolating affected systems from the network. This is followed by eradication, where the root cause (malware, compromised accounts, or vulnerabilities) is removed. Post-incident activities include **documentation and lessons learned** to prevent similar incidents in the future.

## SOC Practical Exposure

In a simulated SOC environment, a SIEM tool is used to display **real-time alerts and logs**. Examples include unusual login times, multiple failed authentication attempts, execution of suspicious binaries, or logins from new locations.

This practical exposure demonstrates how SOC analysts **observe alerts, investigate events, and correlate logs** to identify potential security incidents in real time.
