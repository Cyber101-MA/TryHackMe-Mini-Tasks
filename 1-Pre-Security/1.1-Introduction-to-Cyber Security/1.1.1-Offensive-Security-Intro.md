# 1.1.1 Offensive Security — Summary

Offensive security is the practice of intentionally attempting to gain unauthorized access to systems in order to identify weaknesses before real attackers exploit them. Its purpose is defensive improvement: discovering flaws in authentication, authorization, configuration, or logic so they can be fixed proactively.

A core principle of offensive security is thinking like an attacker. Understanding attacker mindset and techniques helps security professionals recognize how seemingly small weaknesses can be combined into real attack paths.

Many attacks do not rely on advanced malware or zero-day exploits. Instead, they succeed through business logic flaws, weak access controls, and poor security assumptions, as demonstrated by conceptual scenarios such as unauthorized financial transactions.

Common offensive security career paths include penetration testers, who assess systems within a defined scope; red teamers, who emulate real adversaries to test detection and response; and security engineers, who design and harden systems to resist exploitation. Consistent learning and practice are emphasized as the foundation for building strong offensive and defensive security skills.
