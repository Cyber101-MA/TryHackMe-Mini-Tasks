# What is a Network

## Objective
Understand what a network is, the purpose it serves, and why every SOC analyst must grasp its fundamentals.

## Core Concepts

- **Definition:** A network is a collection of devices (computers, servers, switches, routers, IoT devices) connected to share data and resources.
- **Purpose:** Enables communication, resource sharing, and centralized management.
- **Types of Networks:**
  - **LAN (Local Area Network):** Small, localized network (office, lab)
  - **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Spans large geographic areas
  - **Peer-to-Peer:** Direct communication between devices without centralized servers
- **Key Components:**  
  - Devices (clients, servers)  
  - Network devices (switches, routers, firewalls)  
  - Communication channels (wired, wireless)

## SOC Relevance

- Every log in a SOC originates from networked devices. Understanding networks is essential to interpret alerts.  
- Different network types influence how logs are generated and collected.  
- Knowing network components helps identify abnormal activity and potential attack surfaces.  
- Foundational for analyzing DNS, authentication, and SIEM log pipelines.
